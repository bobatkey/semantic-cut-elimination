\section{Mechanisation in Agda}
\label{sec:mechanisation}

We developed the proof in the previous two sections in the Agda proof
assistant \cite{Agda264}. The source code for this development is
available at this URL:

\end{center}

The formalisation uses setoids to represent sets, reusing definitions
from the Agda Standard Library \cite{AgdaStdlib20}. Each of the
definitions and propositions above links to the corresponding part of
the development.

As well as giving confidence in our results, a key benefit of
formalising the development in a proof assistant like Agda is that the
proof normalisation process (Theorem \ref{thm:cut-elim}) is
executable. For example, we can normalise the one step SMAV proof
(using \RuleLabel{Axiom}) of $\vP \vParr \vDual{\vP}$ where
$\vP = (\vUnit \vPlus \vUnit) \vSeq (\vUnit \vWith \vUnit)$ to a FIXME
step MAV proof, given in the Appendix.

\bob{Wen: do you want to write something about the formalisation of
  the congruence rules in the proof system?}
