\begin{enumerate}
  \item We define an algebraic semantics for MAV. Due to the close
        connection between Deep Inference and categorical/algebraic logic
        (CITE: Hughes), this is a relatively straightforward adaptation, but
        is needed for what follows. SECTIONREF.
  \item We demonstrate that a useful class of MAV-algebras can be
        constructed from
