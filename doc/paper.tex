  \begin{abstract}
    \emph{Multiplicative-Additive System Virtual} (MAV) is a logic
    that extends \emph{Multiplicative-Additive Linear Logic} with a
    self-dual non-commutative operator expressing the concept of
    ``before'' or ``sequencing''. MAV is also an extenson of the the
    logic \emph{Basic System Virtual} (BV) with additives. Formulas in
    BV have an appealing reading as processes with parallel and
    sequential composition. MAV adds internal and external choice
    operators. BV and MAV are also closely related to \emph{Concurrent
      Kleene Algebras}.

    \medskip

    Proof systems for MAV and BV
    are \emph{Deep Inference} systems, which allow inference rules to
    be applied anywhere inside a structure.
    As with any proof system, a key question is whether proofs in MAV
    can be reduced to a normal form, removing detours and the
    introduction of structures not present in the original goal. In
    Sequent Calcluli systems, this property is referred to as
    \emph{Cut Elimination}. Deep Inference systems have an analogous
    Cut rule and other rules that are not present in normalised
    proofs. Cut Elimination for Deep Inference systems has the same
    metatheoretic benefits as for Sequent Calculi systems, including
    consistency and decidability.

    \medskip

    Proofs of Cut Elimination for BV, MAV, and other Deep Inference
    systems present in the literature have relied on intrincate
    syntactic reasoning and complex termination measures. For Linear
    Logic, Okada has pioneered semantic proofs of Cut Elimination,
    using Girard's Phase Space model of Linear Logic and techniques
    akin to Normalisation by Evaluation in $\lambda$-calculus, which
    avoid this intrincate reasoning, but these have not been extended
    to the Deep Inference systems for BV and MAV.

    \medskip

    In this work, we present a concise semantic proof that all MAV
    proofs can be reduced to a normal form avoiding the Cut rule and
    other ``non analytic'' rules. Due to the self-dual ``before''
    connective, we cannot use Okada's Phase Space technique, which
    relies on closure under double negation. We build the model more
    directly using closed lower sets and the Chu construction. We also
    develop soundness and completeness proofs of MAV (and BV) with
    respect to a class of models. We have mechanised all our proofs in
    the Agda proof assistant, which provides both assurance of their
    correctness as well as yielding an executable normalisation
    procedure.
