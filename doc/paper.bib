  abstract = {We give a natural extension of Girard's phase semantic completeness proof of the (first order) linear logic Girard (Theoret. Comput. Sci., 1987) to a phase semantic cut-elimination proof. Then we extend this idea to a phase semantic cut-elimination proof for higher order linear logic. We also extend the phase semantics for provability to a phase semantics-like framework for proofs, by modifying the phase space of monoid domain to that of proof-structures (untyped proofs) domain, in a natural way. The resulting phase semantic-like framework for proofs provides various versions of proof-normalization theorem.}
