  abstract   = {This article introduces a logical system, called BV, which extends multiplicative linear logic by a noncommutative self-dual logical operator. This extension is particularly challenging for the sequent calculus, and so far, it is not achieved therein. It becomes very natural in a new formalism, called the calculus of structures, which is the main contribution of this work. Structures are formulas subject to certain equational laws typical of sequents. The calculus of structures is obtained by generalizing the sequent calculus in such a way that a new top-down symmetry of derivations is observed, and it employs inference rules that rewrite inside structures at any depth. These properties, in addition to allowing the design of BV, yield a modular proof of cut elimination.},

  abstract = {We give a natural extension of Girard's phase semantic completeness proof of the (first order) linear logic Girard (Theoret. Comput. Sci., 1987) to a phase semantic cut-elimination proof. Then we extend this idea to a phase semantic cut-elimination proof for higher order linear logic. We also extend the phase semantics for provability to a phase semantics-like framework for proofs, by modifying the phase space of monoid domain to that of proof-structures (untyped proofs) domain, in a natural way. The resulting phase semantic-like framework for proofs provides various versions of proof-normalization theorem.}
